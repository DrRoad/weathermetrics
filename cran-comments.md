## NOTES
This receives a NOTE as a new submission of an archived package. I am the same maintainer as the weathermetrics 1.0 package, which was archived on 2014-09-19 as vignette locations were never updated for R 3.1.0. I no longer have access to the email address I used when maintaining that earlier version of the package (geanders@jhsph.edu). Since I do not have access to this old email, I will not be able to send you an email from that address confirming my change of email address for this version. Please let me know if there is an alternative to confirm my change of email as maintainer.
